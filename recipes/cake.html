    <p>     Kuglóf is a traditional Central European yeast cake, baked in its signature ridged mold. Soft, airy, and lightly sweet, it’s often flavored with raisins, nuts, or a dusting of powdered sugar. Simple yet elegant, this classic cake is perfect for breakfast, afternoon coffee, or as a festive treat to share.</p>
